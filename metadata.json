  "description": "A dark-themed, animated single-page e-commerce React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.",
  "userPrompt": "Create a professional e-commerce website use animations, colors dark ",
  "designSystem": "The design system enforces a strict dark mode aesthetic, utilizing a deep slate base (bg-slate-900) to provide high contrast for vibrant accent colors. The primary color palette is built around a neon-indigo theme: primary actions use 'bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-500' with 'text-white', creating a glowing effect on interaction. Secondary actions utilize a muted 'bg-slate-800 text-slate-200' scheme, while tertiary actions are transparent with a 'text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-300' transition. Success and error states are defined as 'bg-emerald-600' and 'bg-rose-600' respectively. \n\nTypography follows a modular scale using the 'Inter' or system sans-serif stack. Headings are bold and scaled: 'h1' is 'text-4xl md:text-6xl', 'h2' is 'text-3xl md:text-5xl', and 'h3' is 'text-2xl md:text-3xl'. Body text remains readable with 'text-base text-slate-300' and 'text-lg text-slate-400' for supporting copy. \n\nComponents are designed with micro-interactions. Buttons implement a 'transition-all duration-200' base, with 'hover:-translate-y-0.5' for elevation and 'focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-400' for accessibility. Cards serve as the primary content container, featuring 'bg-slate-800/50 border border-slate-700' to distinguish them from the background, rounded corners ('rounded-xl'), and subtle 'shadow-lg' on hover. Inputs are styled with 'bg-slate-900 border border-slate-700 text-white placeholder:text-slate-500' and a specific focus state 'focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-1 focus:ring-indigo-500'. \n\nAnimations are hardware-accelerated using opacity and transform properties. A custom 'fadeInUp' class defines 'animate-fade-in-up' keyframes for entry transitions. Navigation is sticky 'sticky top-0' with a backdrop blur. Accessibility is paramount; 'prefers-reduced-motion: motion-reduce' utilities are applied to disable animations for sensitive users, and all interactive elements have explicit focus rings. The layout uses a mobile-first grid system, expanding from a single column on mobile to multiple columns on 'md' and 'lg' breakpoints.",
  "architecture": "The application is a state-driven Single Page Application (SPA) contained entirely within 'src/pages/Index.tsx'. Global state is managed via a React context or a custom hook within 'App.tsx' to track the active 'section' (e.g., 'home', 'products', 'about', 'contact') and a 'mounted' state for triggering transitions. Navigation is implemented without routing libraries; clicking a link updates the state, triggering a 'setTimeout' or 'useEffect' to unmount the current component and mount the new one. Scrolling is handled programmatically by accessing the 'offsetTop' of specific section refs. Component mounting is staggered using 'setTimeout' to achieve a cascading animation effect.",

  "responsiveStrategy": "The application employs a strict mobile-first development strategy. Base styles apply to mobile devices (screens < 640px). The 'sm' breakpoint (>= 640px) introduces minor layout adjustments like increased padding. The 'md' breakpoint (>= 768px) typically converts single-column layouts into two columns (e.g., product grids, form layouts). The 'lg' breakpoint (>= 1024px) expands to three columns and adjusts navigation for horizontal spacing. The 'xl' and '2xl' breakpoints (>= 1280px / 1536px) are reserved for max-width constraints and large-scale container adjustments. Tailwind utility classes handle all visibility (hidden/md:block) and spacing changes."
